# Trees

## Introduction

A **tree** is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. The topmost node is called the root, and each node can have child nodes. Special types of trees include binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and red-black trees.

## Purpose and Usage

-   Trees are used in scenarios like hierarchical data representation (file systems, organizational charts) and efficient searching.
-   Binary search trees (BST) allow efficient searching, insertion, and deletion with average O(log n) time complexity.
-   Self-balancing trees like AVL and Red-Black trees ensure balanced operations.

## Implementations

-   Binary tree (traversal: in-order, pre-order, post-order).
-   Binary search tree (insertion, deletion, search).
-   AVL tree (self-balancing).
-   Red-Black tree (self-balancing).
