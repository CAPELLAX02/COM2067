# Stacks

## Introduction

A **stack** is a LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure where elements are added (pushed) and removed (popped) from the top. Stacks are widely used for scenarios where elements need to be processed in reverse order of insertion.

## Purpose and Usage

-   Stacks are used in applications like undo functionality, expression evaluation, and parenthesis matching.
-   Common operations include push, pop, peek, and checking if the stack is empty or full.

## Implementations

-   Array-based stack.
-   Dynamic (resizable) stack using an array.
-   Linked-list-based stack.
-   Advanced applications: infix to postfix conversion, postfix expression evaluation.
