# Queues

## Introduction

A **queue** is a FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front. Queues are used when order preservation is critical.

## Purpose and Usage

-   Queues are used in scheduling algorithms, task management, and simulations.
-   Common operations include enqueue, dequeue, peek, and checking if the queue is empty or full.

## Implementations

-   Simple array-based queue.
-   Circular queue (solves the problem of unused space in arrays).
-   Linked-list-based queue.
-   Priority queue (using a heap).
