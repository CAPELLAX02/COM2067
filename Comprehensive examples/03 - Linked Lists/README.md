# Linked Lists

## Introduction

A **linked list** is a dynamic data structure where each element (node) contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists are not stored in contiguous memory locations, allowing for efficient insertion and deletion.

## Purpose and Usage

-   Linked lists are used when you need dynamic memory allocation without fixed sizes.
-   Common operations include traversal, insertion, deletion, and searching.
-   Variants like doubly linked lists and circular linked lists are used in more complex scenarios.

## Implementations

-   Singly linked list (insert, delete, search, traversal).
-   Doubly linked list (with both forward and backward traversal).
-   Circular linked list (with head and tail pointer).
