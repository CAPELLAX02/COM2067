# Hashing

## Introduction

**Hashing** is a technique used to map keys to values using a hash function. It is used in hash tables where a key is converted to an index in a fixed-size table.

## Purpose and Usage

-   Hash tables provide efficient data retrieval with an average time complexity of O(1).
-   Used in dictionaries, caches, and sets.
-   Collision handling is an essential part of hashing (open addressing and separate chaining).

## Implementations

-   Simple hash table with separate chaining.
-   Open addressing (linear probing and quadratic probing).
-   Collision handling techniques.
