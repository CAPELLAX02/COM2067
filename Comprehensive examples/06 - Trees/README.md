# Trees

## Introduction

A **tree** is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. The topmost node is called the root, and each node can have child nodes. Trees are widely used in computer science due to their ability to represent hierarchical relationships and support efficient operations such as searching, insertion, and deletion.

## Types of Trees

### 1. General Tree
A tree in which nodes can have an arbitrary number of children.

### 2. Binary Tree
A tree where each node has at most two children, commonly referred to as the left and right child.

- **Applications**:
  - Expression evaluation (e.g., parsing arithmetic expressions).
  - Representing binary heap in priority queues.

### 3. Binary Search Tree (BST)
A binary tree with the property that the value of each node in the left subtree is less than the parent node, and the value in the right subtree is greater.

- **Operations**:
  - **Insertion**: Average O(log n).
  - **Deletion**: Average O(log n).
  - **Search**: Average O(log n).

### 4. Self-Balancing Trees
These trees maintain a balanced structure to ensure operations are efficient even in the worst case.

#### AVL Tree
- Balances the tree by ensuring the height difference (balance factor) between the left and right subtrees is at most 1.
- Guarantees O(log n) operations for insertion, deletion, and search.

#### Red-Black Tree
- Ensures balance by following specific rules such as red-black coloring of nodes and rotation-based balancing.

### 5. B-Tree
A self-balancing tree often used in databases and file systems. It is optimized for systems that read and write large blocks of data.

## Applications

- **Hierarchical data representation**: File systems, organizational charts.
- **Efficient searching and sorting algorithms**: Binary search trees, AVL trees.
- **Memory management**: Binary heaps.
- **Databases and indexing**: B-Trees.
- **Text processing**: Tries for prefix matching and auto-completion.
