# Strings

## Introduction

Strings are sequences of characters, commonly used to represent and manipulate text. In C, strings are arrays of characters terminated by a null character (`\0`). This folder contains various examples of string manipulation, searching, and advanced string algorithms with interactive programs to engage users in learning.

## Contents

### 1. **Basic String Manipulations**

This subfolder contains interactive examples for:

-   **Getting String Length**: Calculate the length of a string.
-   **Concatenating Strings**: Combine two strings.
-   **Copying Strings**: Copy one string to another.

### 2. **Searching in Strings**

This subfolder includes:

-   **Substring Search**: Find the first occurrence of a substring within a string.

### 3. **Advanced String Algorithms**

This subfolder provides interactive implementations for:

-   **Palindrome Check**: Check if a string is the same forwards and backwards, ignoring case and non-alphabetic characters.
-   **Anagram Detection**: Determine if two strings are anagrams (i.e., contain the same characters in different order).
-   **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm**: Efficient substring search with O(n) complexity.
-   **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**: Find the longest common subsequence between two strings using dynamic programming.
-   **Z Algorithm**: Pattern matching algorithm to find all occurrences of a pattern in a string with O(n) complexity.
