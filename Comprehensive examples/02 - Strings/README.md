# Strings

## Introduction

A **string** is a sequence of characters, typically used to represent text. In C, strings are represented as arrays of characters terminated by a null character (`\0`).

## Purpose and Usage

-   Strings are used to handle text and character-based operations.
-   Common operations include concatenation, comparison, searching for substrings, and reversing.
-   Strings play a crucial role in many real-world problems like pattern matching, parsing, and validation.

## Implementations

-   Basic string manipulation (concatenation, length calculation, reversing).
-   String searching algorithms (Brute Force, Knuth-Morris-Pratt).
-   Palindrome checking and anagram detection.
