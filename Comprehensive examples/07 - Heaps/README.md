# Heaps

## Introduction

A **heap** is a complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property: in a max-heap, the parent node is always greater than or equal to its children; in a min-heap, the parent is always smaller.

## Purpose and Usage

-   Heaps are used in implementing priority queues and algorithms like Heap Sort.
-   Operations include insertion, deletion (extract max/min), and heapify.

## Implementations

-   Max-heap and min-heap.
-   Heap sort algorithm.
-   Priority queue implementation using a heap.
