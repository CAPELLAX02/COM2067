# Arrays

## Introduction

An **array** is a collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations. It is one of the most basic and widely used data structures. Arrays can store elements of a fixed size and type, such as integers or characters.

## Purpose and Usage

-   Arrays allow fast, direct access to elements using an index.
-   They are used for storing fixed-size data collections like lists of numbers or characters.
-   Arrays are often used in algorithms that need to work on a predefined number of elements.

## Implementations

-   Basic one-dimensional array operations (access, insert, delete, update).
-   Multi-dimensional arrays (2D arrays) and examples of their usage.
-   Searching algorithms on arrays (Linear search, Binary search).
-   Sorting algorithms (Bubble sort, Insertion sort, Selection sort).
