# Arrays

## Introduction

Arrays are a basic data structure that store elements in contiguous memory locations. They allow direct access to elements via indexing and are widely used for storing and manipulating collections of data. This folder contains examples of various array operations with interactive programs to help users learn how to perform basic and advanced tasks with arrays.

## Contents

### 1. **Basic Array Operations**

This subfolder contains interactive examples for:

-   Displaying the array.
-   Inserting and deleting elements at specific positions.
-   Traversing the array.

### 2. **Searching**

This subfolder includes implementations of:

-   **Linear Search**: A basic search that checks each element sequentially.
-   **Binary Search**: An efficient search algorithm that works on sorted arrays by dividing the array in halves.

### 3. **Sorting**

Examples of sorting algorithms included:

-   **Bubble Sort**: Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements to sort the array.
-   **Selection Sort**: Finds the smallest element and swaps it with the current element in each iteration.

### 4. **Multi-dimensional Arrays**

This subfolder contains:

-   Operations on 2D arrays, such as displaying elements and updating specific elements.
-   Matrix addition for simple mathematical operations on 2D arrays.

## Purpose

Each subfolder provides hands-on interactive examples to allow users to practice and understand common operations performed on arrays, ranging from basic manipulation to more advanced searching and sorting techniques.
